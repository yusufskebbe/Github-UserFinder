1) constructor runs when componenet rendered

2)constructor must have super() function which point on the father componenet

3) when can use style in componenet by addin style={{}} but without the - sections

4)destructure: if we have objects in the state and we want to use the objects in the componenet we can destrcture the objects by using a const = {state objects} = this.state then we dont have to put this.state.objectName

5) rec is class base componenet shortcut

6) map() is high order map method and this take a callback function

7) when we render a list we get error which is undefind key, we should declare key when we use list 

8) if we want to use propsType in class base componenet we use "static defaultProps = {

        title:"GitHub Finder",
        icon:'fab fa-github'

    }; 

9) if we want to use propsType in functional componenet we put them under the return function with function name infront of the propType

10) render is lifecyle method 
    'componenetDidMount()' it is fired when the componenet Mount
    when we want to make an http request we should do it here in this part 

     componentDidMount(){

    axios.get('https://api.github.com/users').then(res =>{
    
      console.log(res.data)

    })

  }

    we can use something like above or


    async componenetDidMount(){

        const res = await axios.get('link')
        clg(res.data)
    }

 11) if we want to restore our secret keys or api's we use .env.local because when we deploy we don't want those information put on server

 12) this key word, works diffrenet in arrow function

 13) we use Link componenet to prevent lost data when we come back to to the router
